Duration: 5 hours from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM (PST)
Impact: The web application's checkout process was down, and customers were unable to complete their orders. The issue affected 25% of users attempting to make a purchase.
Root Cause: A database server failure due to insufficient disk space.

Timeline:

2:00 PM: The issue was detected when several customers reported being unable to complete their checkout process.
2:05 PM: The engineering team received an alert for increased error rates on the checkout server.
2:10 PM: The team started investigating the issue and checked the logs of the checkout server, but found no indication of errors.
2:20 PM: The team checked the database server logs and found multiple errors indicating insufficient disk space.
2:25 PM: The team attempted to free up disk space by removing some old log files, but it did not resolve the issue.
2:35 PM: The team realized that the root cause of the issue was insufficient disk space and started investigating why the disk space had run out.
3:00 PM: The team found that a large number of temporary files generated by the web application were taking up disk space and causing the failure.
4:00 PM: The team resolved the issue by deleting the temporary files and freeing up enough disk space.
5:00 PM: The team restored the checkout service and verified that it was functioning correctly.
7:00 PM: The issue was fully resolved, and the checkout service was functioning correctly.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was insufficient disk space on the database server due to a large number of temporary files generated by the web application. The resolution of the issue involved deleting these temporary files to free up enough disk space to restore the checkout service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be taken:

Increase the size of the database server to allow for more disk space and reduce the likelihood of running out of space.
Implement regular cleanup of temporary files generated by the web application to prevent the accumulation of unnecessary files.
Implement monitoring and alerting for disk space usage to detect and resolve disk space issues before they affect the system.
Conduct a postmortem analysis to identify any additional root causes and areas for improvement in the system and processes.
TODO:

Increase the size of the database server to allow for more disk space.
Implement a scheduled cleanup of temporary files generated by the web application.
Implement monitoring and alerting for disk space usage.
Conduct a postmortem analysis to identify additional areas for improvement.
